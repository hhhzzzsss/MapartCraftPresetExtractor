# MapartCraft Preset Extractor
In one of my projects I need to be able to pull the block data and colors from a MapartCraft preset into a json file, so I made this quick program. You just need to copy over the coloursJSON.json file from their github, specify the preset string and version in the code, and run.

I originally pulled this data using a quick script in the js console, but they recently rewrote the site in React so that became impossible.
